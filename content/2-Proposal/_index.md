Cost-Optimized SaaS Task Management Platform
============================================

Single-Region High Availability with ECS Fargate
------------------------------------------------

* * * * *

### **1\. Executive Summary**

The SaaS Task Management Platform is designed to deliver a Todoist-like collaborative experience with **High Availability (HA)** and **Cost Efficiency**, specifically optimized for **AWS Free Tier** constraints.

Initially, the project targeted a **Multi-Region deployment** to achieve the high levels of global performance, disaster recovery (DR), and uptime. However, due to the **cost limitations** and the constraints of the **AWS Free Tier** (particularly concerning cross-region data transfer and running multiple primary/replica database instances), the architecture was strategically consolidated into a **Single AWS Region (ap-southeast-1 - Singapore)**.

Built on **Spring Boot microservices** deployed as **ECS Fargate containers**, the platform now leverages Multi-AZ deployment within Singapore for resilience while eliminating server management overhead.

**Key Architecture Highlights:**

-   **Serverless Compute:** ECS Fargate eliminates EC2 instance management

-   **Regional High Availability:** Multi-AZ deployment for compute (ECS), database (RDS), and caching (ElastiCache)

-   **Low Latency in SEA:** Optimized performance for Southeast Asian users

-   **Global Content Delivery:** CloudFront CDN for worldwide static asset distribution

-   **Cost Predictability:** Architecture designed to maximize AWS Free Tier benefits

-   **Disaster Recovery:** S3 Cross-Region Replication to us-east-1 for data backup

The result is a production-ready, cost-effective platform that balances performance, availability, and operational simplicity---ideal for MVP development and regional deployment, while maintaining a clear roadmap for **future Multi-Region expansion**.

### **2\. Problem Statement & Solution**

#### **2.1. The Challenge: Balancing Performance, Availability, and Cost**

Traditional SaaS platforms face critical trade-offs when operating on limited budgets:

**Operational Complexity:**

-   EC2-based deployments require constant server management (patching, monitoring, capacity planning)

-   Manual scaling decisions lead to over-provisioning (wasted money) or under-provisioning (poor performance)

-   Complex deployment processes prone to human error and downtime

**Cost Challenges:**

-   Multi-region architectures introduce expensive cross-region data transfer

-   Running RDS Read Replicas in multiple regions quickly exhausts Free Tier limits

-   NAT Gateway charges ($35+/month) consume significant portions of small budgets

-   Always-on EC2 instances waste capacity during off-peak hours

**Availability vs. Budget:**

-   Single-region deployments risk total outage during regional failures

-   Multi-AZ configurations increase costs but are essential for production workloads

-   Balancing HA requirements with Free Tier constraints requires careful architecture

#### **2.2. The Single-Region ECS Solution**

This project adopts a **Single-Region (ap-southeast-1) High Availability** architecture using **ECS Fargate** for serverless compute, optimizing for cost while maintaining production-grade reliability.

**Core Architecture Decisions:**

**Compute Layer (Serverless):**

-   **ECS Fargate** for containerized Spring Boot microservices (no EC2 management)

-   **Application Load Balancer** for traffic distribution and health checks

-   **AWS Cloud Map** for service discovery between microservices

-   **Auto Scaling** based on CPU/memory metrics

**Data Layer (Regional + Multi-AZ):**

-   **RDS MySQL (db.t3.micro)** with Multi-AZ for automated failover

-   **ElastiCache Redis (cache.t3.micro)** for session management and caching

-   **S3** with Cross-Region Replication to us-east-1 for disaster recovery

**Network Layer (Global + Regional):**

-   **VPC** with public/private subnets across 2 Availability Zones

-   **CloudFront CDN** for global static asset delivery

-   **Route 53** for DNS management and domain hosting

-   **VPC Endpoints** to eliminate NAT Gateway costs ($35/month savings)

**Security & Observability:**

-   **Security Groups** for network-level access control

-   **IAM Roles** for service-to-service authentication (no hardcoded credentials)

-   **Origin Access Control (OAC)** to secure S3 buckets

-   **CloudWatch** for centralized logging, metrics, and alarms

**Key Advantages Over Traditional Architecture:**

| **Aspect** | **Traditional EC2** | **ECS Fargate (This Project)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Server Management | Manual patching, monitoring, SSH access | Fully managed, no server access needed |
| Scaling | Manual ASG configuration | Automatic based on metrics |
| Deployment | Complex, multi-step process | Rolling updates with zero downtime |
| Cost Model | Pay for running instances (24/7) | Pay only for container runtime |
| Free Tier | 750 EC2 hours/month | 20 GB-hours + 50 GB data transfer |
| Startup Time | 2-5 minutes (AMI boot) | 30-60 seconds (container start) |

#### **2.3. Benefits and ROI**

**Technical Benefits:**

-   **80% reduction** in operational overhead (no server management)

-   **99.5%+ uptime** with Multi-AZ deployment for RDS and ECS

-   **<100ms API response time** for cached requests

-   **2-5 minute** recovery time for AZ failures (automatic)

**Cost Benefits:**

-   **~$25-30/month** operational cost (vs $50-90 with EC2)

-   **VPC Endpoints** eliminate $35/month NAT Gateway charges

-   **Pay-per-use** pricing---only charged for actual container runtime

-   **Free Tier optimized** to stay within budget constraints

**Learning & Career Value:**

-   Hands-on experience with modern cloud-native architecture

-   Container orchestration expertise (Docker, ECS Fargate)

-   DevOps practices: IaC, CI/CD, monitoring, incident response

-   Portfolio project demonstrating AWS Solutions Architect competencies

    → ALB Path-Based Routing:
      /api/* → API Gateway Target Group (Port 8080)

API Gateway Internal Routing (Port-based, via Cloud Map):
    /auth/*   → Auth Service (Port 9999)
    /users/*  → User Service (Port 8081)
    /taskflow/*  → Taskflow Service (Port 8082)
    /notifications/* → Notification Service (Port 9998)

```

*Internal Service-to-Service:*

```
Service A → AWS Cloud Map (service-b.local:PORT)
          → Direct container-to-container communication
          → Response cached in Redis (5-minute TTL)

```

**Container Configuration:**

-   **Base Image:** `eclipse-temurin:21-jre-alpine` (lightweight JRE)

### **5\. Service Flow**

#### **5.1. User Request Flow**

**Static Assets (Frontend - HTML, CSS, JS, Images):**

1.  User accesses `https://sgutodolist.com`

2.  Route 53 resolves DNS to CloudFront distribution

3.  CloudFront checks nearest edge location cache:

    -   **Cache HIT:** Returns asset immediately (latency <20ms)

    -   **Cache MISS:** Fetches from S3 origin (Singapore), caches for 24 hours

4.  Browser loads frontend application

5.  Static assets served with low latency globally via edge locations

**API Requests (Backend Microservices):**

1.  Frontend makes API call: `https://sgutodolist.com/api/task`

2.  Route 53 resolves to Application Load Balancer in Singapore

3.  ALB performs SSL termination and routes all `/api/*` traffic to the **API Gateway Target Group (Port 8080)**.

4.  API Gateway (running on ECS) receives the request and **internally routes** via AWS Cloud Map based on the path:

    -   Requests to `/api/auth/**` are routed to **Auth Service (Port 9999)**.

    -   Requests to `/api/user/**` are routed to **User Service (Port 8081)**.

    -   Requests to `/api/taskflow/**` are routed to **Taskflow Service (Port 8082)**.

    -   Requests to `/api/notifications/**` are routed to **Notification Service (Port 9998)**.

5.  The target microservice processes the request.

**Data Access Pattern (90% Reads, 10% Writes):**

*Read Operations:*

1.  Spring Boot service receives request

2.  Check ElastiCache Redis for cached data:

    -   **Cache HIT:** Return immediately (latency <5ms)

    -   **Cache MISS:** Query RDS MySQL (Multi-AZ), cache result with TTL

3.  Response returned through ALB to user

4.  Total latency: 5-10ms (cached) or 20-50ms (database query)

*Write Operations:*

1.  Spring Boot service validates request

2.  Write to RDS MySQL primary database

3.  RDS synchronously replicates to standby instance (same region, different AZ)

4.  Invalidate/update related cache entries in Redis

5.  Async: Trigger notifications, update search index

6.  Success response to user

7.  Total latency: 50-100ms

**Service-to-Service Communication:**

Example: API Gateway needs to validate a JWT token via Auth Service

1.  API Gateway queries AWS Cloud Map: `http://auth-service.local:9999/validate`

2.  Cloud Map resolves to healthy Auth Service task private IP

3.  Direct container-to-container communication within VPC (no ALB overhead)

4.  Response cached in Redis for 5 minutes to reduce repeated calls

5.  Latency: 10-20ms for first call, <5ms for subsequent cached calls

#### **5.2. Developer Deployment Flow**

**CI/CD Pipeline (Manual Process, Automatable with CodePipeline):**

**Phase 1: Local Development**

1.  Developer updates Spring Boot microservice code

2.  Run unit tests: `./mvnw test`

3.  Run integration tests with Docker Compose (local MySQL + Redis)

4.  Commit changes to Git repository

**Phase 2: Container Build**

1.  Build Spring Boot JAR: `./mvnw clean package`

2.  Build Docker image:

    ```
    FROM eclipse-temurin:21-jre-alpineWORKDIR /appCOPY target/task-service.jar app.jarEXPOSE 8084HEALTHCHECK CMD curl -f http://localhost:8084/actuator/health || exit 1ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]

    ```

3.  Tag image: `task-service:v1.2.3`

**Phase 3: Push to ECR**

```
# Authenticate to ECR
aws ecr get-login-password --region ap-southeast-1 |\
  docker login --username AWS --password-stdin {account-id}.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com

# Tag and push
docker tag task-service:v1.2.3\
  {account-id}.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/task-service:v1.2.3
docker push {account-id}.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/task-service:v1.2.3

```

**Phase 4: Update ECS Task Definition**

1.  Navigate to ECS console → Task Definitions → `task-service`

2.  Create new revision:

    -   Update container image to `:v1.2.3`

    -   Review environment variables (DB_HOST, REDIS_HOST, etc.)

    -   Verify resource allocation (0.5 vCPU, 1GB RAM)

3.  Register new task definition revision

**Phase 5: Deploy to ECS Service (Rolling Update)**

1.  Navigate to ECS Service → `task-service`

2.  Update service to use new task definition revision

3.  ECS performs automatic rolling update:

    -   Launch 2 new tasks with updated image

    -   Wait for tasks to pass ALB health checks (3 consecutive passes)

    -   ALB starts routing 50% traffic to new tasks

    -   Drain connections from old tasks (30-second timeout)

    -   Stop old tasks once fully drained

4.  Total deployment time: 3-5 minutes (zero downtime)

**Phase 6: Verification & Monitoring**

1.  Check ECS Service events: `aws ecs describe-services`

2.  Monitor CloudWatch Logs for errors: `/ecs/task-service`

3.  Test API endpoints via ALB: `curl https://sgutodolist.com/api/task/health`

4.  Check CloudWatch Metrics: CPU, memory, request count, error rate

5.  Monitor ALB Target Health in console

**Rollback Procedure (If Issues Detected):**

1.  Identify last known good task definition revision (e.g., `v1.2.2`)

2.  Update ECS Service to use previous revision

3.  ECS performs automatic rollback deployment (3-5 minutes)

4.  Verify health checks pass and logs show no errors

5.  Investigate issue in lower environments before next deployment

**Future Automation (Phase 2 Roadmap):**

-   **GitHub Actions:** Trigger builds on push to `main` branch

-   **AWS CodePipeline:** Source (GitHub) → Build (CodeBuild) → Deploy (ECS)

-   **Blue/Green Deployments:** Use CodeDeploy for safer production rollouts

-   **Automated Testing:** Integration tests run before deployment

#### **5.3. Data Replication & Storage Strategy**

**Data Storage & Backup Matrix:**

| **Data Type** | **Primary Storage** | **Replication Method** | **Backup** | **RPO** | **RTO** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Transactional Data** (users, boards, tasks) | RDS MySQL Multi-AZ | Synchronous (within AZs) | Automated snapshots (daily, 7-day retention) | <1 minute | 10-20 minutes (AZ failure), 2-4 hours (region failure) |
| **Session Tokens** | ElastiCache Redis | None (ephemeral) | None (regenerate on failure) | N/A | Immediate (users re-authenticate) |
| **User Files** (attachments, avatars) | S3 Singapore | CRR to S3 Virginia (async) | Versioning (30-day retention) | 5-15 minutes | Immediate (CloudFront failover) |
| **Static Assets** (frontend code) | S3 Singapore | CRR to S3 Virginia (async) | Versioning + git repository | 5-15 minutes | Immediate (CloudFront failover) |
| **Application Logs** | CloudWatch Logs | Regional replication (managed by AWS) | 7-day retention | N/A | N/A |
| **Docker Images** | ECR Singapore | Manual push to other regions if needed | Image versioning | N/A | Minutes (pull from ECR) |

**S3 Cross-Region Replication Configuration:**

-   **Source Bucket:** `sgutodolist-assets-sg` (ap-southeast-1)

-   **Destination Bucket:** `sgutodolist-assets-us` (us-east-1)

-   **Replication Rules:**

    -   Replicate all objects (prefix: `/`)

    -   Replicate metadata, tags, and object ACLs

    -   **Do NOT** replicate delete markers (prevent accidental data loss)

    -   Priority: `1` (highest)

-   **Versioning:** Enabled on both source and destination

-   **Expected Latency:** 5-15 minutes for most objects (<1MB)

-   **Use Case:** Disaster recovery + CloudFront origin failover

#### **5.4. High Availability & Disaster Recovery**

**Failure Scenarios & Automated Response:**

**Scenario 1: Single ECS Task Failure**

-   **Detection:** ALB health check fails (3 consecutive failures at 10-second intervals)

-   **Automatic Response:**

    -   ALB stops routing new requests to unhealthy task

    -   Existing connections drained (30-second timeout)

    -   ECS Service Controller launches replacement task automatically

-   **Impact:** Zero user-facing downtime (other tasks handle load)

-   **Recovery Time:** 2-3 minutes (container start + health check pass)

-   **User Experience:** No interruption

**Scenario 2: Complete Service Failure (All Tasks Unhealthy)**

-   **Detection:** All 2 tasks for a service fail health checks, ALB returns 503 errors

-   **Automatic Response:** ECS attempts to launch replacement tasks

-   **Manual Intervention Required:**

    -   Check CloudWatch Logs for root cause (database connection timeout, memory leak, bad deployment)

    -   If bad deployment: Rollback to previous task definition revision

    -   If infrastructure issue: Check RDS/Redis connectivity, Security Groups

-   **Impact:** Service unavailable until new tasks healthy or issue resolved

-   **Recovery Time:** 5-15 minutes (depends on issue complexity)

-   **Mitigation:** Implement circuit breakers, graceful degradation

**Scenario 3: Availability Zone Failure (e.g., AZ-1a Goes Down)**

-   **Detection:** All tasks in AZ-1a become unreachable, ALB marks them unhealthy

-   **Automatic Response:**

    -   ALB immediately routes all traffic to tasks in healthy AZ (AZ-1b)

    -   ECS Service launches replacement tasks in healthy AZs to restore desired count

    -   RDS Multi-AZ: If primary DB in failed AZ, RDS automatically fails over to standby (60-120 seconds)

-   **Impact:**

    -   30-50% capacity reduction for 5-10 minutes (temporary latency increase)

    -   Possible 60-120 second database unavailability during RDS failover

-   **Recovery Time:** 5-10 minutes for full capacity restoration

-   **User Experience:** Slight performance degradation, no data loss

**Scenario 4: RDS Primary Database Failure**

-   **Detection:**

    -   RDS health checks fail

    -   Application logs show connection timeouts to database

    -   CloudWatch alarm triggers: `DatabaseConnections` metric drops to 0

-   **Automatic Response:**

    -   RDS Multi-AZ automatically promotes standby instance to primary

    -   DNS endpoint (`sgutodolist-db.xxxxx.ap-southeast-1.rds.amazonaws.com`) updated to point to new primary

    -   Application connection pools automatically reconnect (Spring Boot retry logic)

-   **Impact:** 60-120 seconds of database write unavailability

-   **Recovery Time:** 1-2 minutes (fully automated)

-   **Data Loss:** Zero (synchronous replication to standby)

**Scenario 5: Complete Regional Failure (Singapore Outage)**

-   **Detection:**

    -   Route 53 health checks fail for Singapore ALB

    -   CloudWatch alarms trigger: All ECS tasks unreachable

    -   Manual verification: AWS Service Health Dashboard confirms regional issue

-   **Manual DR Process:**

    *Option A: Read-Only Mode (15-30 minutes)*

    1.  Update CloudFront origin to use S3 Virginia bucket (static assets still work)

    2.  Display maintenance page to users: "Service temporarily unavailable"

    3.  Wait for AWS to restore Singapore region

    *Option B: Full Recovery to New Region (2-4 hours)*

    1.  Restore latest RDS snapshot to new region (us-east-1):

        ```
        aws rds restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot \  --db-instance-identifier sgutodolist-dr \  --db-snapshot-identifier rds:sgutodolist-db-2024-12-07-00-00 \  --db-instance-class db.t3.micro \  --availability-zone us-east-1a

        ```

    2.  Create new ECS Fargate cluster in us-east-1

    3.  Deploy all 5 microservices using existing task definitions (update DB endpoint)

    4.  Create new ALB in us-east-1, configure target groups

    5.  Update Route 53 to point to new ALB

    6.  Update CloudFront origin to use new ALB for API calls

-   **Impact:** Full service outage during recovery

-   **Recovery Time:** 2-4 hours (manual process)

-   **Data Loss:** Last 5-60 minutes (RDS automated backups every 5 minutes, snapshots hourly)

-   **Cost:** Additional resources in us-east-1 (~$30/month if kept running)

**Disaster Recovery Metrics:**

-   **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** <1 hour (RDS automated backups)

-   **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):**

    -   AZ failure: 5-10 minutes (automatic)

    -   Regional failure: 2-4 hours (manual)

-   **Availability Target:** 99.5% (43 minutes downtime/month allowance)

#### **6.2. Cost Optimization Strategies**

**Immediate Savings (Implemented):**

1.  **✅ VPC Endpoints Instead of NAT Gateway (-$28/month)**

    -   **Before:** NAT Gateway ($32/month) + data processing ($3/month) = $35/month

    -   **After:** VPC Endpoints ($7/month for 3 endpoints)

    -   **Savings:** $28/month ($336/year)

    -   **Trade-off:** None---endpoints are more secure and faster

2.  **✅ Single-Region Deployment (-$50+/month)**

    -   **Before:** Multi-region (Singapore + Sydney) with cross-region data transfer

    -   **After:** Single region with S3 CRR for DR only

    -   **Savings:** No second RDS instance ($15), no second ElastiCache ($12), no second ALB ($16), no cross-region data transfer ($10-20)

    -   **Trade-off:** Users outside SEA experience higher API latency (acceptable for MVP)

3.  **✅ ECS Fargate with Minimal Resources (-$10-15/month vs larger EC2)**

    -   **Configuration:** 0.5 vCPU, 1GB RAM per task (Fargate minimum)

    -   **Savings:** Efficient resource allocation, pay only for what you use

    -   **Trade-off:** Monitor performance, scale up if needed

**Additional Optimizations (Consider if Budget Exceeded):**

1.  **Reduce ECS Task Count During Off-Peak Hours**

    -   Current: 2 tasks per service (10 total) running 24/7

    -   Optimization: Scale down to 1 task per service during 12am-8am SGT

    -   **Potential Savings:** ~$6/month

    -   **Risk:** Reduced redundancy during off-hours

2.  **Optimize CloudWatch Log Retention**

    -   Current: 7-day retention (3GB logs)

    -   Optimization: Reduce to 3-day retention

    -   **Potential Savings:** ~$1-2/month

    -   **Trade-off:** Shorter log history for debugging

3.  **Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering**

    -   Automatically moves infrequently accessed objects to cheaper storage tiers

    -   **Potential Savings:** $0.50-1/month

    -   **Trade-off:** Minimal retrieval delay for cold objects

4.  **Disable RDS Multi-AZ Temporarily (NOT RECOMMENDED)**

    -   **Savings:** ~$7.50/month (50% reduction)

    -   **CRITICAL RISK:** No automatic failover, accept downtime during DB failures

    -   **Use Case:** Only for development/testing environments

**Revised Budget Scenarios:**

| **Scenario** | **Monthly Cost** | **Annual Cost** | **Use Case** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Current (Free Tier - Month 1)** | $31.70 | - | Initial launch with Free Tier benefits |
| **Standard (Post Free Tier)** | $67.70 | $812/year | Production after Free Tier expires |
| **Optimized (Off-peak scaling)** | $61.70 | $740/year | Budget-conscious production |
| **Development (No Multi-AZ)** | $60.20 | $722/year | Testing environment only |

#### **6.3. Free Tier Monitoring & Budget Alerts**

**Critical Free Tier Limits to Track:**

| **Service** | **Free Tier Limit** | **Monthly Allowance** | **Alert Threshold** | **Monitoring Method** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **ECS Fargate** | 20 GB-hours | First month only | 16 GB-hours (80%) | CloudWatch custom metric + AWS Budgets |
| **RDS** | 750 hours | Single-AZ only (Multi-AZ NOT covered) | N/A (always paid) | N/A |
| **ElastiCache** | 750 node-hours | Monthly (cache.t2.micro or t3.micro) | 700 hours (93%) | CloudWatch billing metric |
| **ALB** | 750 hours + 15 LCUs | Monthly | 700 hours (93%) | AWS Cost Explorer |

**Performance Optimization:**

*Caching Strategy:*

| **Data Type** | **Cache Location** | **TTL** | **Eviction Policy** | **Monitoring Metric** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| User sessions | Redis | 30 minutes | TTL-based | Session count, hit rate >90% |
| User profiles | Redis | 5 minutes | LRU | Hit rate >85% |
| Board metadata | Redis | 10 minutes | LRU | Hit rate >80% |
| Task lists | Redis | 2 minutes | LRU | Hit rate >75% |
| Static reference data | Redis | 1 hour | TTL-based | Hit rate >95% |

*Database Query Optimization:*

```
-- Add indexes for common queries
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_board_id ON tasks(board_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_assignee_id ON tasks(assignee_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_tasks_status ON tasks(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_boards_user_id ON boards(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_board_members_user_id ON board_members(user_id);

-- Monitor slow queries (>500ms)
SET GLOBAL slow_query_log = 'ON';
SET GLOBAL long_query_time = 0.5;

```

*Application-Level Optimizations:*

-   **Pagination:** Max 100 items per page, default 20

-   **Lazy Loading:** Use JPA `fetch = FetchType.LAZY` for relationships

-   **Connection Pooling:** HikariCP with max 20 connections per task

-   **Response Compression:** gzip enabled on ALB (automatic)

-   **API Rate Limiting:** 100 requests/minute per user (prevent abuse)

**Disaster Recovery Testing:**

*Monthly DR Drill (30 minutes):*

| **Test** | **Procedure** | **Expected Result** | **Pass/Fail** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1\. ECS Task Failure | Manually stop one task | ALB routes traffic to healthy task, new task launches in 2-3 min |   |
| 2\. Cache Failure | Restart Redis cluster | App reconnects automatically, regenerates cache |   |
| 3\. Deployment Rollback | Deploy bad task definition, then rollback | Service returns to previous version in 3-5 min |   |
| 4\. RDS Snapshot Restore | Restore snapshot to new instance | Database accessible, data integrity verified |   |

*Quarterly Full DR Exercise (2 hours):*

1.  **Simulate Complete Regional Failure**

    -   Mark all Singapore resources as "unavailable"

    -   Document current RTO/RPO baselines

2.  **Execute DR Runbook:**

    ```
    Step 1: Restore RDS snapshot to us-east-1 (30 minutes)
    Step 2: Create ECS cluster in us-east-1 (10 minutes)
    Step 3: Deploy all 5 services with updated DB endpoint (20 minutes)
    Step 4: Create and configure ALB in us-east-1 (15 minutes)
    Step 5: Update Route 53 to point to new ALB (5 minutes)
    Step 6: Update CloudFront origin for API calls (10 minutes)
    Step 7: End-to-end testing (20 minutes)

    ```

3.  **Verify Complete Functionality:**

    -   User can log in and access their boards

    -   Tasks can be created, updated, deleted

    -   File uploads work correctly

    -   Notifications are sent

4.  **Document Findings:**

    -   Actual RTO achieved vs target (2-4 hours)

    -   Issues encountered and resolutions

    -   Updates needed to DR runbook

    -   Cost of maintaining DR environment
