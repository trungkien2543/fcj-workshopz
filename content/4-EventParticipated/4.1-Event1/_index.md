### Event Experience

Participating in the workshop **"Vietnam Cloud Day 2025: Ho Chi Minh City Connect Edition for Builders"** was a very beneficial experience, helping me gain a comprehensive view of application modernization and modern tools. Some notable experiences:

#### Learning from highly skilled speakers
- Speakers from AWS and major technology organizations shared **best practices** in modern application design.
- Through real case studies, I better understand how to apply **Migration, Modernization,** and **Cloud Security** to large projects.

#### Networking and exchange
- The workshop created opportunities for direct exchange with experts, colleagues, and business teams, helping to **enhance ubiquitous language** between business and tech.
- Through practical examples, I realized the importance of a **business-first approach**, always starting from business needs rather than just focusing on technology.

#### Lessons learned
- Modernization strategy needs a **phased approach** with measurement and accurate assessment of current state, should not rush to transform the entire system.
- AI tools like Amazon Q Developer can **boost productivity** if integrated into current development workflows.
