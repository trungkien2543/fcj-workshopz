# **Tech-savvy savings: innovative ways to cut costs in your small businessn**

*Henrique Trevisan, Jonathan Woods, and Vince Anderson* | **23/4/2024** | in [Best Practices](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/smb/category/post-types/best-practices/), [Permalink](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/smb/tech-savvy-savings-innovative-ways-to-cut-costs-in-your-small-business/)

Running a small business means making the most of every dollar while maintaining high-quality services. As your business grows and your cloud usage expands, you must find ways to efficiently manage technology resources to protect your bottom line. In today’s challenging economic environment, cost optimization has become a top priority for business owners who want to reduce expenses without sacrificing performance, security, or customer experience.

This blog post explores practical strategies — in the short, medium, and long term — for small businesses to optimize their cloud costs while continuing to leverage the powerful capabilities that cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS) offer. Whether you’re just starting your cloud journey or looking to refine your existing setup, these insights will provide valuable guidance on making smart technology investments while keeping costs in check.

## Quick wins for immediate cost savings
### 1. Modernize your storage strategy

Many small businesses overpay for data storage because they haven’t optimized their configuration. Smart storage management involves three key strategies:

- Implement tiering by moving rarely accessed data to lower-cost storage options, keeping only frequently used information in premium storage.
- Right-size your storage allocations—many businesses pay for significantly more space than they actually use.
- Configure your storage performance settings to match your actual needs rather than using default configurations.

This balanced approach can reduce storage costs while maintaining or even improving performance. These optimizations require minimal technical effort but deliver immediate and ongoing savings to your monthly bill.

### 2. Eliminate unnecessary certificate expenses

Why pay a third party for [Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security(SSL/TLS)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/ssl-certificate/) certificates when you can get them for free? Many businesses continue paying annual fees to certificate providers out of habit, often spending hundreds of dollars annually for something now available at no cost. By moving your website security certificates to Amazon Route 53 using [AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/), you eliminate these recurring expenses while gaining automatic certificate renewal. Small businesses that make this switch remove the administrative burden of tracking expiration dates and manually renewing certificates. This straightforward change reduces both costs and security risks with minimal implementation effort.

### 3. Optimize your log data retention

Many businesses unknowingly store log data longer than necessary, increasing their cloud storage costs month after month. Many log management tools allow you to implement automated retention policies that align with your actual business requirements. By configuring appropriate log retention periods—rather than using unlimited default settings—you can substantially reduce your storage footprint while maintaining compliance. On AWS, [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) makes this process straightforward with simple controls to retain critical security logs for 90 days while reducing operational logs to just 30 days. This customized approach typically reduces log storage costs compared to indefinite retention, and the automation keeps your team from having to manually delete outdated logs. For most compliance frameworks, 30-90 days of logs is sufficient rather than retaining years of rarely-accessed data.

## Mid-term cost optimization strategies
### 1. Consolidate network resources while maintaining security

As your business grows to serve multiple clients or departments, creating completely separate cloud environments for each seems like the safest approach. While this works initially, it multiplies your costs unnecessarily as you scale. Smart businesses are finding ways to share core network infrastructure while using [virtual boundaries using a service such as Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html) to keep client data securely separated. This balanced approach can help you accomplish your security and [compliance](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/) goals while reducing redundant network components. Companies implementing this network consolidation strategy can experience a reduction in their monthly infrastructure costs without compromising client data isolation. The savings become increasingly significant as your business adds more clients, creating a more efficient growth model that maintains security while eliminating wasteful duplication.

### 2. Optimize your content delivery costs

Content delivery networks help websites load faster by caching content closer to users, but many small businesses pay for global coverage when their customers are concentrated in just a few regions. Reviewing your actual user geography and aligning your content delivery strategy accordingly can yield significant savings. For example, if your business primarily serves North American and European customers, you can select regional coverage options in [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) rather than the default global setting. This approach helps reduce your content delivery costs while maintaining fast performance in the markets that matter to your business. Geographic optimization creates immediate savings without any negative impact on your actual customer experience.

### 3. Automate routine tasks with AI

Time is money, especially for small businesses where teams wear multiple hats. [Generative AI](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/generative-ai/) tools can now automate many repetitive tasks, freeing team capacity to focus on growth activities. For example, sales teams can use AI assistance to generate customized proposals based on previous successful bids, dramatically reducing the time spent on repetitive documentation. Similarly, customer service teams can deploy AI to handle routine inquiries, reducing response times while maintaining your brand voice across all customer interactions. By identifying these high-volume, repeatable tasks in your business, AI automation reduces labor costs while improving consistency and allowing your valuable human resources to focus on strategy and relationship-building.

This approach has proven effective for companies like[Creative Realities, Inc](https://cri.com/). Bart Massey, their EVP of Software Development, reports, “Using [Amazon Q Business](https://aws.amazon.com/q/) to build a private model for our product information has cut our RFP and RFI response times by over 50%, allowing us to respond faster to client requests from day one.” Their experience demonstrates how generative AI can significantly streamline business processes, leading to improved efficiency and responsiveness in customer interactions.

## Building cost efficiency in the long-term
### 1. Reduce software development costs

Software development expenses can quickly consume your technology budget. Modern code assistance tools accelerate development by suggesting completions, identifying bugs early, and automating routine coding tasks. [Amazon Q Developer](https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/) exemplifies this approach, reducing costly rework by catching issues before they reach production and providing real-time guidance throughout the development process. This AI-powered assistant helps developers implement best practices, write secure code, and troubleshoot issues faster. When coupled with [Infrastructure as Code (IaC)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/iac/) practices, businesses can standardize environments from development through production, eliminating time-consuming manual configurations and reducing provisioning time from days to minutes. Companies implementing these approaches can experience lower development costs while simultaneously accelerating their time to market.

### 2. Automate infrastructure management

Create resources when needed and remove them when not in use. Use [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/lambda/) with  [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/eventbridge/) schedules to automatically shut down development environments after hours and restart them before the workday begins, thereby reducing non-production environment costs by running resources only during working hours. Another effective approach is automating scaling actions for predictable business cycles by employing [AWS Auto Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/) groups to automatically increase capacity during busy periods and scale down during slower periods. These automation strategies can deliver cost reductions for targeted workloads.

### 3. Rethink your system architecture

Not every part of your business technology needs premium “always-on” protection. Apply a layered approach: invest in redundancy only for critical customer-facing components while using standard setups for internal tools. For example, a business can maintain high-availability only for client-facing systems using flexible deployment options from [Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/). Similarly, moving completed client projects to archival tiers from[Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) while maintaining accessibility can also reduce costs. For businesses with predictable busy periods, services like [Amazon Aurora Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/) automatically adjust resources during peak times and scale down during quieter periods, generating savings compared to maintaining constant maximum capacity. By matching system reliability to actual business needs, most small businesses can reduce cloud costs without affecting critical

## Conclusion

Optimizing your cloud costs doesn’t have to mean compromising quality or capabilities. By implementing these strategies, small businesses can reduce expenses while continuing to leverage powerful technology to drive growth and innovation. Start with quick wins like optimizing storage and certificate management, then progress to more sophisticated approaches like network resource sharing and AI-powered automation. Each step you take will contribute to long-term savings and efficiency.

Remember that cost optimization is an ongoing journey. As your business grows and evolves, continue to reassess your technology needs and adjust your strategy accordingly. With thoughtful planning and implementation of these approaches, you can build a cost-efficient, scalable technology foundation that supports your business objectives both today and in the future.
