# **Cost-Optimized SaaS Task Management Platform**

### **Overview**
**SGU TodoList** is a robust and resilient task management application built using a **Microservices architecture** designed for high scalability and decoupling. The primary goal of this workshop is to guide you through deploying and managing a complex application stack on the AWS Cloud platform, with a strong focus on **cost optimization** and **serverless operations**.

By leveraging core AWS services such as **ECS Fargate**, **S3**, **ALB**, and **VPC**, you will learn how to set up an infrastructure that is performant, highly available, and minimizes overhead costs compared to traditional EC2 instances.
