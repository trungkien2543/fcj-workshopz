### Additional Questions

- What I am most satisfied with during the internship is the positive and enjoyable working environment. Everyone is always willing to support and share their knowledge.  

- If I were to recommend this internship to friends, I would do so because it is an opportunity to experience a modern professional working environment, learn cutting-edge knowledge in the industry, and connect with an active and highly skilled community, such as the AWS Study Group.  

### Suggestions & Expectations

- I would like to suggest that some of the current labs are slightly outdated in terms of the AWS interface compared to the screenshots in the lab materials, which may result in some steps being missing or different during practical exercises. In addition, some AWS services have updated certain operations compared to the guidance provided, which can make practice a bit challenging. This is my feedback aimed at improving the learning experience during the internship.
