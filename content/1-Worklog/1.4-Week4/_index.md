### Week 4 Achievements:

* Understand about storage services on S3

* Practice hosting a static website using Amazon S3:
  * Know how to initialize an S3 and upload data of the static website to it
  * Practice configuring AWS CloudFront to host a static website on S3 without having to public information about the bucket
  * Learn about the Bucket Versioning to preserve and restore versions of all objects stored in the bucket
  * Learn about the Amzon S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) to automatically copy objects across different AWS regions

* Practice implementing backups for the system, understand the two main concepts of RPO and RTO

* Learn how to import virtual machines from VMware to Amazon EC2 instances and migrate EC2 instances back to on-premises VMware environments. 

* Practice managing system access using AWS IAM by:
  * Creating an IAM user with permissions to access Amazon S3, and using the userâ€™s access keys to upload files from a server to an S3 bucket.
  * Creating an IAM role for EC2 instances that grants S3 upload permissions, enabling secure access to S3 without embedding access keys (thus avoiding credential exposure).

* Practice using IAM PERMISSION BOUNDARY to limit user permissions, thereby simplifying permission management and avoiding the assignment of unnecessary privileges.
