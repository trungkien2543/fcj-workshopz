    <description>Event Summary: “AWS CLOUD MASTERY SERIES #3 – Security on AWS” Event Objectives A deep-dive sharing session that helps participants understand the 5 security pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar and how to protect cloud systems against increasing threats.&#xA;Sharing about security-supporting services and system auditing methods to protect AWS accounts and systems from attacks.&#xA;An opportunity to connect with the First Cloud Journey community.&#xA;Speakers Le Vu Xuan An: AWS Cloud Club Captain HCMUTE, First Cloud AI Journey Tran Duc Anh: AWS Cloud Club Captain SGU, First Cloud AI Journey, Cloud Security Engineer Trainee Tran Doan Cong Ly: AWS Cloud Club Captain PTIT, First Cloud AI Journey Dang Hoang Hieu Nghi: AWS Cloud Club Captain HUFLIT, First Cloud AI Journey Nguyen Tuan Thinh: First Cloud AI Journey, Cloud Engineer Trainee Huynh Hoang Long: First Cloud AI Journey, Cloud Engineer Trainee Dinh Le Hoang Anh: First Cloud AI Journey, Cloud Engineer Trainee Nguyen Do Thanh Dat: First Cloud AI Journey, Cloud Engineer Trainee Van Hoang Kha: First Cloud AI Journey, Cloud Engineer Trainee Thinh Lam: First Cloud AI Journey Viet Nguyen: First Cloud AI Journey Mendel Grabski (Long): ex Head of Security &amp; DevOps, Cloud Security Solutions Architect Tinh Truong: AWS Community Builder, Platform Engineer at TymeX Key Highlights Identity &amp; Access Management Service Understand what IAM is used for Best practices for using IAM in system security SCP and permission boundaries for multi-account setups MFA, credential rotation, Access Analyzer Detection &amp; Continuous Monitoring CloudTrail (org-level), GuardDuty, Security Hub Logging at all layers: VPC Flow Logs, ALB/S3 logs Alerting &amp; automation with EventBridge Detection-as-Code (infrastructure + rules) Infrastructure Protection VPC segmentation, private vs public placement Security Groups vs NACLs: usage models WAF + Shield + Network Firewall Workload protection: EC2, ECS/EKS security basics Data Protection KMS: key policies, grants, rotation Encryption at-rest &amp; in-transit: S3, EBS, RDS, DynamoDB Secrets Manager &amp; Parameter Store — rotation patterns Data classification &amp; access guardrails Incident Response AWS Incident Response lifecycle Playbooks: Compromised IAM key S3 public exposure EC2 malware detection Snapshot, isolation, evidence collection Auto-response using Lambda/Step Functions Key Takeaways How to protect a personal AWS account Apply the Least Privilege Principle for IAM Users Do not use the root account for daily tasks Avoid using “*” in policy actions/resources Enable MFA for enhanced security Overview of GuardDuty An intelligent threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activities in AWS accounts and workloads. GuardDuty analyzes data from multiple sources including: AWS CloudTrail logs, VPC Flow Logs, DNS logs (Route 53 Resolver DNS query logs). Can use CloudFormation to build EventBridge rules that trigger Lambda functions and send SNS notifications when GuardDuty detects threats. Principles for building secure systems How to use Security Groups and NACLs to defend against external and internal threats. Understand common attack vectors to react and mitigate in time. Use services like AWS WAF, AWS Network Firewall, and AWS Shield Advanced (for DDoS protection) to strengthen system security both externally and internally. Using KMS to encrypt and protect data Create and manage encryption keys Control who can use or manage these keys Monitor all KMS-related activities with CloudTrail Event Experience Participating in the “AWS CLOUD MASTERY SERIES #3 – Security on AWS” workshop was a highly valuable experience, giving me a broader understanding of how to protect accounts and systems from basic to advanced levels. Some notable experiences:</description>
