Expertise &amp; resource shortages: Current security teams are operating at maximum capacity and spending most of their time on repetitive, low-value tasks. Scale and complexity: Managing security at scale in diverse and complex cloud environments is a major challenge. Evolving threat landscapes: New attack tactics and technologies continuously emerge, creating an ever-changing risk environment. Data protection &amp; privacy demands: To maintain customer trust, organizations must meet strict data protection and privacy requirements according to industry regulations (e.g., GDPR, PCI-DSS…).
