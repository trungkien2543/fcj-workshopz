    <description>During my internship at AMAZON WEB SERVICES VIETNAM COMPANY LIMITED from 08/09/2025 to 12/12/2025, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge acquired in school to a real-world working environment.&#xA;I participated in learning and working with AWS services while building a Todoist-like task management application, through which I improved my skills in problem-solving, teamwork, self-learning, and application development.&#xA;In terms of work ethic, I always strived to complete tasks well, complied with workplace regulations, and actively engaged with colleagues to improve work efficiency.</description>
