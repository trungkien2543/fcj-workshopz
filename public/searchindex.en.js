    "content": "Technology that teaches empathy? How mpathic uses AI to help us listen to each other by Bonnie McClure and Chalaire Miller | on 30 APR 2024 | Startup, Startup Spotlight\nOn a basic human level, we want to be heard. We want to connect with others, and we want to be understood. Unfortunately, we’re often faced with many things competing for our attention, which makes us bad listeners.Danielle Schlosser, Chief Innovation Officer\nActive listening is a learned behavior and not easy to master. But what if artificial intelligence (AI) could augment our ability to really listen and truly relate to others? What if technology could draw upon our collective lived experiences and help us be more human to each other?\nThese are the questions Dr. Grin Lord, clinical psychologist and founder of conversation analytics company mpathic, has spent the last 15 years chasing. During her research, Grin and the team at mpathic have identified trust-building words, phrases, and communication behaviors and modeled them using AI.\n“We look at what is promoting trust, what is promoting engagement, and how those impact outcomes,” explains mpathic’s Chief Innovation Officer, Dr. Danielle Schlosser.\nIn pursuit of a technology-driven approach to unlock empathy, mpathic developed something unique: a solution that not only analyzes and assesses the health of conversations but also provides recommendations for increasing their levels of empathy, trust, and engagement in real-time.\n“Our differentiator is trying to be more behavioral and actionable,” says Grin. “We want to coach people on how to improve.”\nDrawing on responses from a diverse range of experts with extensive empathy training, mpathic’s API quickly tags instances of misunderstanding within ongoing conversations and immediately offers feedback and suggestions on how to listen and respond with more empathy.\nThe results have been astonishing. When deployed in clinical trials, healthcare providers using mpathic’s API have been seven times more likely to capture participant risk and provide critical feedback. Similarly, in sales and HR software as a service (SaaS) use cases, businesses using mpathic products witnessed more customer engagement, satisfaction, and other outcomes.\nIterating on empathy education Taking context and nuance into consideration, mpathic defines empathy as “accurate understanding.” But designing a successful method for teaching empathy turned out to be much more elusive than defining it.\nIn the early 2000s, Grin began her journey as part of a research study working with drivers involved in drunk driving accidents. The experiment consisted of brief interventions, including 15 minutes of empathic listening, showing acceptance and understanding of the driver’s experience. This brief empathic intervention led to reductions in drinking that held over three years later and a 46 percent reduction in readmissions to the hospital.\nAfter that, Grin trained medical professionals on how to listen with empathy, teaching behaviors such as reflective listening, asking open-ended questions instead of closed-ended ones, and using affirmations.\nWhen she found that a two-day workshop was not enough time to change deep-seated behaviors and styles of communication, she retooled her approach. Grin learned techniques from a nationwide phone coaching study where doctors would record themselves giving feedback. A psychologist would listen and provide doctors with performance-based suggestions on how to improve. This process could take weeks, so in 2008 she seized an opportunity to use machine learning (ML) to speed up the process.\nAt the University of Washington, Grin was a part of the team that built the first speech signal processing pipelines for performance-based feedback in a medical settings. “With the computing power at the time, it took about 6 hours to process a 30-minute call,” she says. “But the fact you could get any feedback the same day was considered really revolutionary.”\nNow, with enhanced computing, power the original vision of performance-based feedback for medical providers was accelerated to actual real-time. Over the years, Grin built a team of dedicated subject matter experts and specialists pulling from those involved in the original research at University of Washington, as well as AI experts at Carnegie Mellon University, and industry experts from big tech.\nThe idea for mpathic came about when Grin and team realized the commercial value of empathic listening: “Could we make an API that would instantly take any communication and make it more empathic, regardless of the use case?”\nThe team built some of mpathic’s first models using data collected from Empathy Rocks, an empathy training game. In the game, therapists, including members of the Idaho State Crisis Line and California Indian Health Service, would respond to anonymous users from data in public forums with empathy and rank each other’s statements; they received continuing education for playing these games. “We had really diverse groups of people building these models through crowdsourcing that information,” explains Grin.\nExpanding empathy training and tools across industries As mpathic continues to evolve and grow their capabilities, the startup now has more than 200 different models for communication behaviors with tips and suggestions, including how to improve collaboration and power-sharing, and listen with more accuracy using reflections and open-ended questions. They also measure more unconscious metrics of human alignment, like language style synchrony, that have been found in Grin’s research to be more predictive of objective ratings of empathy than other skills. “The goal is not to replace human experience,” says Dr. Amber Jolley-Paige, Vice President of Clinical Product, “but to enhance it.”\nWith a tailored and flexible approach, mpathic uses analysis and metrics to support customers’ specific needs and KPIs, whatever the industry. They currently offer a suite of AI-powered products: the core mpathic API, mConsult, and mTrial. The core API integrates into other software, analyzing communications and proposing actionable suggestions. For example, when mpathic used their API to analyze recruitment interviews for different companies, they found that those who received empathetic feedback had an 8 percent increase in candidate acceptance. mConsult provides immediate recommendations and coaching by reviewing audio or video recordings. And mTrial streamlines clinical trials by enhancing data quality and ensuring consistent care, while proactively reducing risk and easing medical professionals’ workloads.\nEnvisioning the future of health equity mpathic’s journey shows no signs of slowing down. To better reach their goal of improving human communication, the team is expanding its API to specifically address diverse cultural behaviors and coach providers in cultural adaptation.\nCulture can affect how people communicate in various ways. For example, it may affect communication styles, how people deliver information, and their attitudes toward conflict. “With mpathic, we have the ability like never before to create more empathy in healthcare interactions and imagine a future where we can leverage AI to improve health equity,” says Dr. Alison Cerezo, Head of Research and Health Equity.\nThe startup built training data from a diverse group of different genders, cultures, and backgrounds to help curb AI bias. “A lot of the issues that you see with AI bias comes down to models built from data collected from only one or two backgrounds and not understanding the lived experience of the people that those models will impact,” explains Grin. mpathic ensures that they regularly build, refine, and deploy their models with attention and alignment to an ethical AI framework.\nMoving forward, the team at mpathic plans to continue developing AI tools that recognize the nuanced and diverse viewpoints present in all human interactions. “There is no limit to the potential of this technology to train anyone to listen with empathy,” says Grin.\nGoing big with AWS To scale their platform, mpathic needed a robust infrastructure. AWS provided a reliable, solid foundation for mpathic to grow and innovate securely. “We built on AWS to help us scale effectively and meet our customers’ needs quickly and seamlessly,” says Grin. “We’re a relatively tiny startup to be serving customers globally. To be able to tell our customers that we can host data wherever they are in the world is awesome, and wouldn’t be possible without AWS.” mpathic uses AWS for all of its foundational platform components, including compute, storage, and networking infrastructure, ensuring secure cross-border data transfer and storage.Megan Greenlaw, VP, Life Sciences and Psychedelic AI\nBeyond technology, collaboration between mpathic and AWS was built on a shared commitment to helping mpathic reach their goals. “There is a degree of interest and support that’s really impressive, especially coming from such a large organization,” says Danielle. “It’s not just about the technology, it’s also about the connections.”\n“AWS has also done a lot of work highlighting women founders, which I think is great,” adds Megan Greenlaw, Vice President of Life Sciences and Psychedelic AI. “To me it signifies a shift that’s happening in venture, the fact that a company can raise over $10 million and that 90% of those checks are being written by women is pretty outstanding,” says Grin.",

    "content": "Tech-savvy savings: innovative ways to cut costs in your small businessn Henrique Trevisan, Jonathan Woods, and Vince Anderson | 23/4/2024 | in Best Practices, Permalink\nRunning a small business means making the most of every dollar while maintaining high-quality services. As your business grows and your cloud usage expands, you must find ways to efficiently manage technology resources to protect your bottom line. In today’s challenging economic environment, cost optimization has become a top priority for business owners who want to reduce expenses without sacrificing performance, security, or customer experience.\nThis blog post explores practical strategies — in the short, medium, and long term — for small businesses to optimize their cloud costs while continuing to leverage the powerful capabilities that cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS) offer. Whether you’re just starting your cloud journey or looking to refine your existing setup, these insights will provide valuable guidance on making smart technology investments while keeping costs in check.\nQuick wins for immediate cost savings 1. Modernize your storage strategy Many small businesses overpay for data storage because they haven’t optimized their configuration. Smart storage management involves three key strategies:\nImplement tiering by moving rarely accessed data to lower-cost storage options, keeping only frequently used information in premium storage. Right-size your storage allocations—many businesses pay for significantly more space than they actually use. Configure your storage performance settings to match your actual needs rather than using default configurations. This balanced approach can reduce storage costs while maintaining or even improving performance. These optimizations require minimal technical effort but deliver immediate and ongoing savings to your monthly bill.\n2. Eliminate unnecessary certificate expenses Why pay a third party for Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security(SSL/TLS) certificates when you can get them for free? Many businesses continue paying annual fees to certificate providers out of habit, often spending hundreds of dollars annually for something now available at no cost. By moving your website security certificates to Amazon Route 53 using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), you eliminate these recurring expenses while gaining automatic certificate renewal. Small businesses that make this switch remove the administrative burden of tracking expiration dates and manually renewing certificates. This straightforward change reduces both costs and security risks with minimal implementation effort.\n3. Optimize your log data retention Many businesses unknowingly store log data longer than necessary, increasing their cloud storage costs month after month. Many log management tools allow you to implement automated retention policies that align with your actual business requirements. By configuring appropriate log retention periods—rather than using unlimited default settings—you can substantially reduce your storage footprint while maintaining compliance. On AWS, Amazon CloudWatch makes this process straightforward with simple controls to retain critical security logs for 90 days while reducing operational logs to just 30 days. This customized approach typically reduces log storage costs compared to indefinite retention, and the automation keeps your team from having to manually delete outdated logs. For most compliance frameworks, 30-90 days of logs is sufficient rather than retaining years of rarely-accessed data.\nMid-term cost optimization strategies 1. Consolidate network resources while maintaining security As your business grows to serve multiple clients or departments, creating completely separate cloud environments for each seems like the safest approach. While this works initially, it multiplies your costs unnecessarily as you scale. Smart businesses are finding ways to share core network infrastructure while using virtual boundaries using a service such as Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to keep client data securely separated. This balanced approach can help you accomplish your security and compliance goals while reducing redundant network components. Companies implementing this network consolidation strategy can experience a reduction in their monthly infrastructure costs without compromising client data isolation. The savings become increasingly significant as your business adds more clients, creating a more efficient growth model that maintains security while eliminating wasteful duplication.\n2. Optimize your content delivery costs Content delivery networks help websites load faster by caching content closer to users, but many small businesses pay for global coverage when their customers are concentrated in just a few regions. Reviewing your actual user geography and aligning your content delivery strategy accordingly can yield significant savings. For example, if your business primarily serves North American and European customers, you can select regional coverage options in Amazon CloudFront rather than the default global setting. This approach helps reduce your content delivery costs while maintaining fast performance in the markets that matter to your business. Geographic optimization creates immediate savings without any negative impact on your actual customer experience.\n3. Automate routine tasks with AI Time is money, especially for small businesses where teams wear multiple hats. Generative AI tools can now automate many repetitive tasks, freeing team capacity to focus on growth activities. For example, sales teams can use AI assistance to generate customized proposals based on previous successful bids, dramatically reducing the time spent on repetitive documentation. Similarly, customer service teams can deploy AI to handle routine inquiries, reducing response times while maintaining your brand voice across all customer interactions. By identifying these high-volume, repeatable tasks in your business, AI automation reduces labor costs while improving consistency and allowing your valuable human resources to focus on strategy and relationship-building.\nThis approach has proven effective for companies likeCreative Realities, Inc. Bart Massey, their EVP of Software Development, reports, “Using Amazon Q Business to build a private model for our product information has cut our RFP and RFI response times by over 50%, allowing us to respond faster to client requests from day one.” Their experience demonstrates how generative AI can significantly streamline business processes, leading to improved efficiency and responsiveness in customer interactions.\nBuilding cost efficiency in the long-term 1. Reduce software development costs Software development expenses can quickly consume your technology budget. Modern code assistance tools accelerate development by suggesting completions, identifying bugs early, and automating routine coding tasks. Amazon Q Developer exemplifies this approach, reducing costly rework by catching issues before they reach production and providing real-time guidance throughout the development process. This AI-powered assistant helps developers implement best practices, write secure code, and troubleshoot issues faster. When coupled with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices, businesses can standardize environments from development through production, eliminating time-consuming manual configurations and reducing provisioning time from days to minutes. Companies implementing these approaches can experience lower development costs while simultaneously accelerating their time to market.\n2. Automate infrastructure management Create resources when needed and remove them when not in use. Use AWS Lambda with Amazon EventBridge schedules to automatically shut down development environments after hours and restart them before the workday begins, thereby reducing non-production environment costs by running resources only during working hours. Another effective approach is automating scaling actions for predictable business cycles by employing AWS Auto Scaling groups to automatically increase capacity during busy periods and scale down during slower periods. These automation strategies can deliver cost reductions for targeted workloads.\n3. Rethink your system architecture Not every part of your business technology needs premium “always-on” protection. Apply a layered approach: invest in redundancy only for critical customer-facing components while using standard setups for internal tools. For example, a business can maintain high-availability only for client-facing systems using flexible deployment options from Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS). Similarly, moving completed client projects to archival tiers fromAmazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) while maintaining accessibility can also reduce costs. For businesses with predictable busy periods, services like Amazon Aurora Serverless automatically adjust resources during peak times and scale down during quieter periods, generating savings compared to maintaining constant maximum capacity. By matching system reliability to actual business needs, most small businesses can reduce cloud costs without affecting critical\nConclusion Optimizing your cloud costs doesn’t have to mean compromising quality or capabilities. By implementing these strategies, small businesses can reduce expenses while continuing to leverage powerful technology to drive growth and innovation. Start with quick wins like optimizing storage and certificate management, then progress to more sophisticated approaches like network resource sharing and AI-powered automation. Each step you take will contribute to long-term savings and efficiency.\nRemember that cost optimization is an ongoing journey. As your business grows and evolves, continue to reassess your technology needs and adjust your strategy accordingly. With thoughtful planning and implementation of these approaches, you can build a cost-efficient, scalable technology foundation that supports your business objectives both today and in the future.\nTo get started on your cost-cutting journey with AWS, reach out to a sales specialist.",
