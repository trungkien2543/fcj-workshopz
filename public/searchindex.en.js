    "content": "Technology that teaches empathy? How mpathic uses AI to help us listen to each other by Bonnie McClure and Chalaire Miller | on 30 APR 2024 | Startup, Startup Spotlight\nOn a basic human level, we want to be heard. We want to connect with others, and we want to be understood. Unfortunately, we’re often faced with many things competing for our attention, which makes us bad listeners.Danielle Schlosser, Chief Innovation Officer\nActive listening is a learned behavior and not easy to master. But what if artificial intelligence (AI) could augment our ability to really listen and truly relate to others? What if technology could draw upon our collective lived experiences and help us be more human to each other?\nThese are the questions Dr. Grin Lord, clinical psychologist and founder of conversation analytics company mpathic, has spent the last 15 years chasing. During her research, Grin and the team at mpathic have identified trust-building words, phrases, and communication behaviors and modeled them using AI.\n“We look at what is promoting trust, what is promoting engagement, and how those impact outcomes,” explains mpathic’s Chief Innovation Officer, Dr. Danielle Schlosser.\nIn pursuit of a technology-driven approach to unlock empathy, mpathic developed something unique: a solution that not only analyzes and assesses the health of conversations but also provides recommendations for increasing their levels of empathy, trust, and engagement in real-time.\n“Our differentiator is trying to be more behavioral and actionable,” says Grin. “We want to coach people on how to improve.”\nDrawing on responses from a diverse range of experts with extensive empathy training, mpathic’s API quickly tags instances of misunderstanding within ongoing conversations and immediately offers feedback and suggestions on how to listen and respond with more empathy.\nThe results have been astonishing. When deployed in clinical trials, healthcare providers using mpathic’s API have been seven times more likely to capture participant risk and provide critical feedback. Similarly, in sales and HR software as a service (SaaS) use cases, businesses using mpathic products witnessed more customer engagement, satisfaction, and other outcomes.\nIterating on empathy education Taking context and nuance into consideration, mpathic defines empathy as “accurate understanding.” But designing a successful method for teaching empathy turned out to be much more elusive than defining it.\nIn the early 2000s, Grin began her journey as part of a research study working with drivers involved in drunk driving accidents. The experiment consisted of brief interventions, including 15 minutes of empathic listening, showing acceptance and understanding of the driver’s experience. This brief empathic intervention led to reductions in drinking that held over three years later and a 46 percent reduction in readmissions to the hospital.\nAfter that, Grin trained medical professionals on how to listen with empathy, teaching behaviors such as reflective listening, asking open-ended questions instead of closed-ended ones, and using affirmations.\nWhen she found that a two-day workshop was not enough time to change deep-seated behaviors and styles of communication, she retooled her approach. Grin learned techniques from a nationwide phone coaching study where doctors would record themselves giving feedback. A psychologist would listen and provide doctors with performance-based suggestions on how to improve. This process could take weeks, so in 2008 she seized an opportunity to use machine learning (ML) to speed up the process.\nAt the University of Washington, Grin was a part of the team that built the first speech signal processing pipelines for performance-based feedback in a medical settings. “With the computing power at the time, it took about 6 hours to process a 30-minute call,” she says. “But the fact you could get any feedback the same day was considered really revolutionary.”\nNow, with enhanced computing, power the original vision of performance-based feedback for medical providers was accelerated to actual real-time. Over the years, Grin built a team of dedicated subject matter experts and specialists pulling from those involved in the original research at University of Washington, as well as AI experts at Carnegie Mellon University, and industry experts from big tech.\nThe idea for mpathic came about when Grin and team realized the commercial value of empathic listening: “Could we make an API that would instantly take any communication and make it more empathic, regardless of the use case?”\nThe team built some of mpathic’s first models using data collected from Empathy Rocks, an empathy training game. In the game, therapists, including members of the Idaho State Crisis Line and California Indian Health Service, would respond to anonymous users from data in public forums with empathy and rank each other’s statements; they received continuing education for playing these games. “We had really diverse groups of people building these models through crowdsourcing that information,” explains Grin.\nExpanding empathy training and tools across industries As mpathic continues to evolve and grow their capabilities, the startup now has more than 200 different models for communication behaviors with tips and suggestions, including how to improve collaboration and power-sharing, and listen with more accuracy using reflections and open-ended questions. They also measure more unconscious metrics of human alignment, like language style synchrony, that have been found in Grin’s research to be more predictive of objective ratings of empathy than other skills. “The goal is not to replace human experience,” says Dr. Amber Jolley-Paige, Vice President of Clinical Product, “but to enhance it.”\nWith a tailored and flexible approach, mpathic uses analysis and metrics to support customers’ specific needs and KPIs, whatever the industry. They currently offer a suite of AI-powered products: the core mpathic API, mConsult, and mTrial. The core API integrates into other software, analyzing communications and proposing actionable suggestions. For example, when mpathic used their API to analyze recruitment interviews for different companies, they found that those who received empathetic feedback had an 8 percent increase in candidate acceptance. mConsult provides immediate recommendations and coaching by reviewing audio or video recordings. And mTrial streamlines clinical trials by enhancing data quality and ensuring consistent care, while proactively reducing risk and easing medical professionals’ workloads.\nEnvisioning the future of health equity mpathic’s journey shows no signs of slowing down. To better reach their goal of improving human communication, the team is expanding its API to specifically address diverse cultural behaviors and coach providers in cultural adaptation.\nCulture can affect how people communicate in various ways. For example, it may affect communication styles, how people deliver information, and their attitudes toward conflict. “With mpathic, we have the ability like never before to create more empathy in healthcare interactions and imagine a future where we can leverage AI to improve health equity,” says Dr. Alison Cerezo, Head of Research and Health Equity.\nThe startup built training data from a diverse group of different genders, cultures, and backgrounds to help curb AI bias. “A lot of the issues that you see with AI bias comes down to models built from data collected from only one or two backgrounds and not understanding the lived experience of the people that those models will impact,” explains Grin. mpathic ensures that they regularly build, refine, and deploy their models with attention and alignment to an ethical AI framework.\nMoving forward, the team at mpathic plans to continue developing AI tools that recognize the nuanced and diverse viewpoints present in all human interactions. “There is no limit to the potential of this technology to train anyone to listen with empathy,” says Grin.\nGoing big with AWS To scale their platform, mpathic needed a robust infrastructure. AWS provided a reliable, solid foundation for mpathic to grow and innovate securely. “We built on AWS to help us scale effectively and meet our customers’ needs quickly and seamlessly,” says Grin. “We’re a relatively tiny startup to be serving customers globally. To be able to tell our customers that we can host data wherever they are in the world is awesome, and wouldn’t be possible without AWS.” mpathic uses AWS for all of its foundational platform components, including compute, storage, and networking infrastructure, ensuring secure cross-border data transfer and storage.Megan Greenlaw, VP, Life Sciences and Psychedelic AI\nBeyond technology, collaboration between mpathic and AWS was built on a shared commitment to helping mpathic reach their goals. “There is a degree of interest and support that’s really impressive, especially coming from such a large organization,” says Danielle. “It’s not just about the technology, it’s also about the connections.”\n“AWS has also done a lot of work highlighting women founders, which I think is great,” adds Megan Greenlaw, Vice President of Life Sciences and Psychedelic AI. “To me it signifies a shift that’s happening in venture, the fact that a company can raise over $10 million and that 90% of those checks are being written by women is pretty outstanding,” says Grin.",

    "content": "Tech-savvy savings: innovative ways to cut costs in your small businessn Henrique Trevisan, Jonathan Woods, and Vince Anderson | 23/4/2024 | in Best Practices, Permalink\nRunning a small business means making the most of every dollar while maintaining high-quality services. As your business grows and your cloud usage expands, you must find ways to efficiently manage technology resources to protect your bottom line. In today’s challenging economic environment, cost optimization has become a top priority for business owners who want to reduce expenses without sacrificing performance, security, or customer experience.\nThis blog post explores practical strategies — in the short, medium, and long term — for small businesses to optimize their cloud costs while continuing to leverage the powerful capabilities that cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS) offer. Whether you’re just starting your cloud journey or looking to refine your existing setup, these insights will provide valuable guidance on making smart technology investments while keeping costs in check.\nQuick wins for immediate cost savings 1. Modernize your storage strategy Many small businesses overpay for data storage because they haven’t optimized their configuration. Smart storage management involves three key strategies:\nImplement tiering by moving rarely accessed data to lower-cost storage options, keeping only frequently used information in premium storage. Right-size your storage allocations—many businesses pay for significantly more space than they actually use. Configure your storage performance settings to match your actual needs rather than using default configurations. This balanced approach can reduce storage costs while maintaining or even improving performance. These optimizations require minimal technical effort but deliver immediate and ongoing savings to your monthly bill.\n2. Eliminate unnecessary certificate expenses Why pay a third party for Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security(SSL/TLS) certificates when you can get them for free? Many businesses continue paying annual fees to certificate providers out of habit, often spending hundreds of dollars annually for something now available at no cost. By moving your website security certificates to Amazon Route 53 using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), you eliminate these recurring expenses while gaining automatic certificate renewal. Small businesses that make this switch remove the administrative burden of tracking expiration dates and manually renewing certificates. This straightforward change reduces both costs and security risks with minimal implementation effort.\n3. Optimize your log data retention Many businesses unknowingly store log data longer than necessary, increasing their cloud storage costs month after month. Many log management tools allow you to implement automated retention policies that align with your actual business requirements. By configuring appropriate log retention periods—rather than using unlimited default settings—you can substantially reduce your storage footprint while maintaining compliance. On AWS, Amazon CloudWatch makes this process straightforward with simple controls to retain critical security logs for 90 days while reducing operational logs to just 30 days. This customized approach typically reduces log storage costs compared to indefinite retention, and the automation keeps your team from having to manually delete outdated logs. For most compliance frameworks, 30-90 days of logs is sufficient rather than retaining years of rarely-accessed data.\nMid-term cost optimization strategies 1. Consolidate network resources while maintaining security As your business grows to serve multiple clients or departments, creating completely separate cloud environments for each seems like the safest approach. While this works initially, it multiplies your costs unnecessarily as you scale. Smart businesses are finding ways to share core network infrastructure while using virtual boundaries using a service such as Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to keep client data securely separated. This balanced approach can help you accomplish your security and compliance goals while reducing redundant network components. Companies implementing this network consolidation strategy can experience a reduction in their monthly infrastructure costs without compromising client data isolation. The savings become increasingly significant as your business adds more clients, creating a more efficient growth model that maintains security while eliminating wasteful duplication.\n2. Optimize your content delivery costs Content delivery networks help websites load faster by caching content closer to users, but many small businesses pay for global coverage when their customers are concentrated in just a few regions. Reviewing your actual user geography and aligning your content delivery strategy accordingly can yield significant savings. For example, if your business primarily serves North American and European customers, you can select regional coverage options in Amazon CloudFront rather than the default global setting. This approach helps reduce your content delivery costs while maintaining fast performance in the markets that matter to your business. Geographic optimization creates immediate savings without any negative impact on your actual customer experience.\n3. Automate routine tasks with AI Time is money, especially for small businesses where teams wear multiple hats. Generative AI tools can now automate many repetitive tasks, freeing team capacity to focus on growth activities. For example, sales teams can use AI assistance to generate customized proposals based on previous successful bids, dramatically reducing the time spent on repetitive documentation. Similarly, customer service teams can deploy AI to handle routine inquiries, reducing response times while maintaining your brand voice across all customer interactions. By identifying these high-volume, repeatable tasks in your business, AI automation reduces labor costs while improving consistency and allowing your valuable human resources to focus on strategy and relationship-building.\nThis approach has proven effective for companies likeCreative Realities, Inc. Bart Massey, their EVP of Software Development, reports, “Using Amazon Q Business to build a private model for our product information has cut our RFP and RFI response times by over 50%, allowing us to respond faster to client requests from day one.” Their experience demonstrates how generative AI can significantly streamline business processes, leading to improved efficiency and responsiveness in customer interactions.\nBuilding cost efficiency in the long-term 1. Reduce software development costs Software development expenses can quickly consume your technology budget. Modern code assistance tools accelerate development by suggesting completions, identifying bugs early, and automating routine coding tasks. Amazon Q Developer exemplifies this approach, reducing costly rework by catching issues before they reach production and providing real-time guidance throughout the development process. This AI-powered assistant helps developers implement best practices, write secure code, and troubleshoot issues faster. When coupled with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices, businesses can standardize environments from development through production, eliminating time-consuming manual configurations and reducing provisioning time from days to minutes. Companies implementing these approaches can experience lower development costs while simultaneously accelerating their time to market.\n2. Automate infrastructure management Create resources when needed and remove them when not in use. Use AWS Lambda with Amazon EventBridge schedules to automatically shut down development environments after hours and restart them before the workday begins, thereby reducing non-production environment costs by running resources only during working hours. Another effective approach is automating scaling actions for predictable business cycles by employing AWS Auto Scaling groups to automatically increase capacity during busy periods and scale down during slower periods. These automation strategies can deliver cost reductions for targeted workloads.\n3. Rethink your system architecture Not every part of your business technology needs premium “always-on” protection. Apply a layered approach: invest in redundancy only for critical customer-facing components while using standard setups for internal tools. For example, a business can maintain high-availability only for client-facing systems using flexible deployment options from Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS). Similarly, moving completed client projects to archival tiers fromAmazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) while maintaining accessibility can also reduce costs. For businesses with predictable busy periods, services like Amazon Aurora Serverless automatically adjust resources during peak times and scale down during quieter periods, generating savings compared to maintaining constant maximum capacity. By matching system reliability to actual business needs, most small businesses can reduce cloud costs without affecting critical\nConclusion Optimizing your cloud costs doesn’t have to mean compromising quality or capabilities. By implementing these strategies, small businesses can reduce expenses while continuing to leverage powerful technology to drive growth and innovation. Start with quick wins like optimizing storage and certificate management, then progress to more sophisticated approaches like network resource sharing and AI-powered automation. Each step you take will contribute to long-term savings and efficiency.\nRemember that cost optimization is an ongoing journey. As your business grows and evolves, continue to reassess your technology needs and adjust your strategy accordingly. With thoughtful planning and implementation of these approaches, you can build a cost-efficient, scalable technology foundation that supports your business objectives both today and in the future.\nTo get started on your cost-cutting journey with AWS, reach out to a sales specialist.",

    "content": "Accelerating the next wave of generative AI startups Swami Sivasubramanian | 13/06/2024 | in AWS for Startups, Featured, Startup, Startup Spotlight | Permalink\nSince day one, AWS has helped startups bring their ideas to life by democratizing access to the technology powering some of the largest enterprises around the world including Amazon. Each year since 2020, we have provided startups nearly $1 billion in AWS Promotional Credits. It’s no coincidence then that 80% of the world’s unicorns use AWS. I am lucky to have had a front row seat to the development of so many of these startups over my time at AWS—companies like Netflix, Wiz, and Airtasker. And I’m enthusiastic about the rapid pace at which startups are adopting generative artificial intelligence (AI) and how this technology is creating an entirely new generation of startups.\nThese generative AI startups have the ability to transform industries and shape the future, which is why today we announced a commitment of $230 million to accelerate the creation of generative AI applications by startups around the world. We are excited to collaborate with visionary startups, nurture their growth, and unlock new possibilities. In addition to this monetary investment, today we’re also announcing the second-annual AWS Generative AI Accelerator in partnership with NVIDIA. This global 10-week hybrid program is designed to propel the next wave of generative AI startups. This year, we’re expanding the program 4x to serve 80 startups globally. Selected participants will each receive up to $1 million in AWS Promotional Credits to fuel their development and scaling needs. The program also provides go-to-market support as well as business and technical mentorship. Participants will tap into a network that includes domain experts from AWS as well as key AWS partners such as NVIDIA, Meta, Mistral AI, and venture capital firms investing in generative AI.\nBuilding in the cloud with generative AI In addition to these programs, AWS is committed to making it possible for startups of all sizes and developers of all skill levels to build and scale generative AI applications with the most comprehensive set of capabilities across the three layers of the generative AI stack. At the bottom layer of the stack, we provide infrastructure to train large language models (LLMs) and foundation models (FMs) and produce inferences or predictions. This includes the best NVIDIA GPUs and GPU-optimized software, custom, machine learning (ML) chips including AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia, as well as Amazon SageMaker, which greatly simplifies the ML development process. In the middle layer, Amazon Bedrock makes it easier for startups to build secure, customized, and responsible generative AI applications using LLMs and other FMs from leading AI companies. And at the top layer of the stack, we have Amazon Q, the most capable generative AI-powered assistant for accelerating software development and leveraging companies’ internal data.\nCustomers are innovating using technologies across the stack. For instance, during my time at the VivaTech conference in Paris last month, I sat down Michael Chen, VP of Strategic Alliances at PolyAI, which offers customized voice AI solutions for enterprises. PolyAI develops natural-sounding text-to-speech models using Amazon SageMaker. And they build on Amazon Bedrock to ensure responsible and ethical AI practices. They use Amazon Connect to integrate their voice AI into customer service operations.\nAt the bottom layer of the stack, NinjaTech uses Trainium and Inferentia2 chips, along with Amazon SageMaker, to build, train, and scale custom AI agents. From conducting research to scheduling meetings, these AI agents save time and money for NinjaTech’s users by bringing the power of generative AI into their everyday workflows. I recently sat down with Sam Naghshineh, Co-founder and CTO, to discuss how this approach enables them to save time and resources for their users.\nLeonardo.AI, a startup from the 2023 AWS Generative AI Accelerator cohort, is also harnessing the capabilities of AWS Inferentia2 to enable artists and professionals to produce high-quality visual assets with unmatched speed and consistency. By reducing their inference costs without sacrificing performance, Leonardo.AI can offer their most advanced generative AI features at a more accessible price point.\nLeading generative AI startups, including Perplexity, Hugging Face, AI21 Labs, Articul8, Luma AI, Hippocratic AI, Recursal AI, and DatologyAI are building, training, and deploying their models on Amazon SageMaker. For instance, Hugging Face used Amazon SagaMaker HyperPod, a feature that accelerates training by up to 40%, to create new open-source FMs. The automated job recovery feature helps minimize disruptions during the FM training process, saving them hundreds of hours of training time a year.\nAt the middle layer, Perplexity leverages Amazon Bedrock with Anthropic Claude 3 to build their AI-powered search engine. Bedrock ensures robust data protection, ethical alignment through content filtering, and scalable deployment of Claude 3. While Nexxiot, an innovator in transportation and supply chain solutions, quickly moved its Scope AI assistant solution to Amazon Bedrock with Anthropic Claude in order to give their customers the best real-time, conversational insights into their transport assets.\nAt the top layer, Amazon Q Developer helps developers at startups build, test, and deploy applications faster and more efficiently, allowing them to focus their valuable energy on driving innovation. Ancileo, an insurance SaaS provider for insurers, re-insurers, brokers, and affinity partners, uses Amazon Q Developer to reduce the time to resolve coding-related issues by 30%, and is integrating ticketing and documentation with Amazon Q to speed up onboarding and allow anyone in the company to quickly find their answers. Amazon Q Business enables everyone at a startup to be more data-driven and make better, faster decisions using the organization’s collective knowledge. Brightcove, a leading provider of cloud video services, deployed Amazon Q Business to streamline their customer support workflow, allowing the team to expedite responses, provide more personalized service, and ultimately enhance the customer experience.\nResources for generative AI startups The future of generative AI belongs to those who act now.

The Cloudera platform enables organizations to manage, process, and analyze massive datasets, helping businesses across industries like finance, healthcare, manufacturing, and telecommunications accelerate AI/ML adoption and unlock real-time insights.\nA key element driving the success of the platform is the development environment, where developers can build and test new features for release. The environment, built on Kubernetes, faced multiple challenges on-premises especially in the scaling and utilization of resources.\nThis post covers how Cloudera modernized its development operations by adopting a hybrid cloud approach built on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). This strategy balances the existing capacity of on-premises environments with the elasticity of the cloud while leveraging enhancements such as Karpenter, Bottlerocker, and Cilium to optimize scaling, security, and cost efficiency.\nOperational Challenges faced On-Premises The development environment faced challenges running on-premises: The environment was required to scale up and down frequently but was constrained by fixed capacity. Build and test processes for services like Apache Spark, Hive, and HBase required containers as large as 64 GB RAM and 32 vCPUs, which quickly exceeded available resources. Pull requests during intensive coding sprints surged as high as 300% leading to 45-minute build time increases, creating a bottleneck in the CI/CD pipeline that significantly slowed development velocity. This, in turn, delayed feature delivery, and risked release schedules while increasing infrastructure costs and developer idle time. The application design also involved retrieving and saving artifacts and datasets from Amazon S3, which introduced latency for on-premises agents, further extending build and test cycles. These constraints created bottlenecks in the development pipeline and highlighted the need for elasticity beyond on-premises clusters. Solution Overview Cloudera addressed these challenges by adopting a hybrid cloud model where predictable workloads remained on-premises and dynamic workloads moved to AWS. The architecture brought together the elasticity of AWS with Cloudera’s established on-premises infrastructure, delivering seamless scaling, reduced latency, and optimized costs.\nHigh-level architecture of the development environment in AWS\nThe modernized Kubernetes architecture provided the following benefits:\nElasticity with Amazon EKS and Karpenter: Cloudera, using Karpenter, was able to scale its workloads from a handful of nodes to thousands within minutes and also contract when demand dropped. This ensured efficient scaling during surges while eliminating idle resource waste during freezes. This also enabled multiple pull requests to run in parallel without waiting for capacity, giving developers faster turnaround times and improving release velocity. Intelligent provisioning ensured that compute instances were always aligned with workload requirements, which improved utilization rates and reduced costs by up to 40%.\nHandling large containers with Karpenter: Build and test jobs requiring massive containers were matched instantly with optimized compute through Karpenter’s intelligent node provisioning. This real-time elasticity ensured no delays or resource contention.\nStrengthening security with Bottlerocket: The linux-based OS further enhanced the scaling process by delivering a container-optimized environment with minimal operating system overhead. Its immutable filesystem strengthened security by preventing unauthorized changes, while atomic updates simplified system patching and reduced maintenance downtime. This change reduced the development environment’s attack surface by 60%, streamlined patching through atomic updates, and improved compute efficiency by 35%.\nReducing build delays with Bottlerocket and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) (Amazon EBS) snapshots: od launch times fell from 30 minutes to seconds using Bottlerocket and Amazon EBS snapshots to pre-cache large images. This improvement gave developers the ability to start new builds almost instantly, transforming productivity. Pull request spikes no longer created bottlenecks.\nScaling network with Cilium: Networking was modernized with Cilium, which provided identity-based security, advanced pod-level observability, and eBPF-driven networking. By introducing flexible IP address management, Cilium allowed Cloudera to scale beyond 10,000 workloads without encountering IP exhaustion issues, all while offering clear visibility into pod-level networking.\nEliminating idle resource waste with AWS Graviton and Flex instances: Graviton và Flex instances đóng vai trò quan trọng trong tối ưu chi phí và hiệu năng. Graviton mang lại lợi ích hiệu năng-giá tốt cho workloads dựa trên ARM, trong khi Flex instances tăng hiệu quả cho các tác vụ biên dịch x64. Kết hợp lại, các tùy chọn tính toán này giảm gần một phần ba chi phí vận hành và tối đa 40% chi phí hạ tầng, đảm bảo Cloudera cân bằng giữa hiệu suất và chi phí cho các nhu cầu workload đa dạng.\nResolving S3 latency with cloud-native integration: Running builds in Amazon EKS, dropped latency to Amazon S3 to milliseconds, accelerating artifact retrieval. This had the additional benefit of lowering network transfer costs by 30%.\nThis holistic solution not only addressed each bottleneck but also created a foundation that scales elastically, operates securely, and optimizes costs across hybrid environments.\nBusiness Outcomes The adoption of this hybrid Kubernetes environment transformed Cloudera’s development operations. Build and test cycle times improved by 50%, enabling faster delivery of new features and improvements. The ability to scale from 10 to more than 1,000 nodes in minutes gave developers reliable access to the resources they needed, eliminating bottlenecks during high demand. By optimizing data transfers with Amazon S3, network costs were reduced by 30% and latency was cut to milliseconds. Intelligent scaling and workload-aligned compute selection lowered infrastructure costs by 40%. Bottlerocket reduced the attack surface by 60% and improved compute efficiency by 35%.\nThese advances not only strengthened security but also delivered freed engineers from infrastructure management and allowing them to focus on core development.\nConclusion Cloudera’s successful implementation showcases the transformative power of AWS’s container stack – Amazon EKS, Karpenter, and Bottlerocket. The modernized Kubernetes environment resulted in seamless scaling, enhanced security, and optimized cost management while delivering peak performance for dynamic workloads. Cloudera’s journey proves how the integration of purpose-built AWS solutions can dramatically improve infrastructure management, reduce operational overhead, and accelerate developer productivity.\nThrough automated node provisioning, intelligent workload placement, and streamlined operations, Cloudera demonstrates how organizations can achieve efficiency in container environments. Following Cloudera’s proven architecture, enterprises can build a robust, scalable, and cost-effective Kubernetes environment that meets today’s demanding development needs while preparing for future growth. Speak with your AWS account team to take the next steps to building a modernized Amazon EKS environment.",
